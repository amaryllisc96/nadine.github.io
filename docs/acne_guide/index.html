<p>According to <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/acne">someone</a>, acne is a &ldquo;disorder of the hair follicles and sebaceous glands&hellip; sebaceous glands secrete oils to keep the skin moist, but clogged glands (because of buildup in hair follicles) lead to pimples and cysts&rdquo;. The primary causes of acne are agreed to be</p>
<ol>
<li>Hormone changes (e.g., from menstrual cycles, pregnancy, birth control pills).</li>
<li>Diet</li>
<li>Certain medicines (e.g., corticosteroids, lithium, or barbiturates).</li>
<li>Genetics</li>
</ol>
<p>A popular hypothesis argues acne is primarily a disease of modern civilization, and in particular, the modern diet. The prevalence of acne among so-called primitives who eat a non-Western diet is near nilch (see <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27651516/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X97002772">here</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12472346/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X97002772">here</a>, and <a href="https://journals.lww.com/nutritiontodayonline/Citation/1977/05000/When_the_Eskimo_Comes_to_Town_.7.aspx">here</a>).</p>
<h2 id="diet">Diet</h2>
<p>The three major food classes which promote acne seem to be (cf. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4507494/">Melnik, 2015</a>):</p>
<ol>
<li>Hyperglycemic carbohydrates (e.g., white and whole wheat bread, white rice, cereal, cakes, sweets, potatoes, watermelon, pineapple).</li>
<li>Milk and dairy products.</li>
<li>Saturated fats including trans-fats (e.g., butter, cheese, ice cream, baked goods) and <em>deficient</em> omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (e.g., need enough of fish, seeds, tofu, eggs).</li>
</ol>
<p>Other commonly suspected causes/triggers of acne are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sugar and processed carbs &ndash; these spike insulin levels which induce your inflamed sebaceous glands to produce more sebum which can lead to more clogging.</li>
<li>Soy &ndash; affects estrogen and androgen levels which can also inflame sebaceous glands.</li>
<li>Peanuts and peanut butter &ndash; contains androgen-like material which can affect hormones.</li>
<li>Alcohol &ndash; also raises certain hormone levels. It also dehydrates you, drying out your skin (which induces skin to produce more oil&hellip;).</li>
<li>Gluten (e.g., bread, baked goods, beer, crackers) &ndash; some people have mild gluten allergies manifesting in inflammation/acne and they don&rsquo;t know it.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="lifestyle-tips">Lifestyle Tips</h2>
<ol>
<li>Use a gentle cleanser (e.g., Cerave Hydrating Cleanser) &ndash; heavier cleansers dehydrate skin, can cause irritation, and change the natural pH of your skin.</li>
<li>Moisturize skin often &ndash; as said above in the comment about alcohol, you want to avoid dry skin.</li>
<li>Drink more water (e.g., 3 liters a day is a good amount) &ndash; ditto.</li>
<li>Sweat more &ndash; sweat flushes out your pores, but probably recommended to wash afterwards so residue does not stick to your skin.</li>
</ol>
